# Air Signature

This is still incomplete. 
I tried implementing some contour level algorithm for signature and then using gaussian filter to make the signature smooth, but that didn't work out that well.

So, in Air_signature.ipynb, we are gonna do something as follows :
**TODO :**

1. Implement media pipe to recognize index finger
2. use empty numpy array as a canvas for our signature
3. Drawing using finger
4. Using some kind of filter, if required, to smoothen our signature
5. Saving it as png to use it in any document or pdf, etc.
